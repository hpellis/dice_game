# Dice Game

This is a simple terminal game I made while learning Python. 

I used the randint function from the random library to simulate dice rolls. The program then asks users to guess whether the sum of two dice rolls is odd or even. The user input is compared to the randomly-generated result and users are told if they were right or wrong. 

## Installation

Clone the repository.

```$ git clone https://github.com/hpellis/dice_game```

Navigate to the directory. 

```$ cd dice_game```

Run dice_game.py from the command line. 

```$ python dice_game.py```
